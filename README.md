Project Overview


This is a mock project to complete the internship at FPT Software Academy.

System Drivers

Drivers for PCC, Systick, GPIO, UART, I2C, and RTC will be utilized, defined according to the documentation for the S32K144.

Each function is being tested and works properly.

System Description


The system includes a fingerprint sensor that recognizes which finger is pressed and compares it with the stored memory in flash. If a match is found, the name of the person is displayed on the LCD, and a buzzer is activated.

Users can register a new fingerprint using a keypad.

Communication


Communication between the LCD and the S32K is established via I2C.

Communication between the AS608 fingerprint sensor and the S32K is conducted over UART.

Communication between the keypad and the S32K is managed through GPIO.

Additional Information


UART is used through openSDA for debugging purposes.

Limitations


The system has a long delay time.

The application does not utilize an operating system (OS); all operations are performed sequentially. If one module fails, the entire system may fail, making it difficult to identify which module is malfunctioning.

The main function contains too much code, and the API functions are not specific to a single task.
